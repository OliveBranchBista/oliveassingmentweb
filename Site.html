                             <h1>My Experience Of Learning:</h1>
                                <p>  I had always been very interested in technology.I enjoy learning new things <br>
                                     and developing my academic skills.This was the first time I was introduced<br> 
                                     with 'coding'. In the beginning it was little confusing and spending more time<br> 
                                     in front of laptop screen,doing coding was eye tiring and hectic. But slowly<br> 
                                     I keep on practicing and I started getting used to it and now it has become one <br>
                                     of my favourite thing to do.<br>I started realizing that there are so many important 
                                     things that one should learn<br> while developing web.Starting with HTML I had already 
                                     basic knowledge about<br> it since my secondary level education.So, it became quite easier
                                     for me but here <br>comes CSS which was completely new to me.First few days is was difficult 
                                     for<br> me to understand the concepts of CSS.But the slides provided by the university <br>
                                     was really helpful to clear my doubts also the lecturer helped me every time I am <br>in 
                                     confusion. Shadow Effect, 2D Transform, 3D Transform, Transitions, Animations<br>are the 
                                     topics I found mostly unique and felt like doing it time and again.

                     <h1>My Design Decisions:</h1>
                        <p>
                            I designed navigation bar containing five web pages like: home page, portfolio <br>page,contact page,
                            blog page and site report. As I'm nature loving person, <br>I choosed natural theme for my portfolio site.
                            I downloaded some copyright free<br>images from google and created a suitable background for each pages.
                            Furthermore,<br>I choosed only those colours which matched the background.<br><br>

                            In the home page I added my name in large font size with blur filter, and use of <br>hover effect plus proper 
                            use of transformation.<br><br>

                            I also made a small section named 'My Gallery' where I designed my page using my <br> own clicked pictures.
                            I also included animation and transition to the heading <br>'My Gallery".                                                   
                            I Implemented shadow effects as well throughout the website.<br><br>
                        
                            Then, I designed footer adding quick access to the pages , my contact details with <br>my location.
                            Overall, my website design is influenced by nature theme and<br> implementation of my HTML and CSS knowledge 
                            as much as possible.
